          Please use pull requests to suggest improvements or additional
          features (I&#39;ve some ideas listed above). Or to help. Or, in fact
          I&#39;m happy to receive, constructive criticism of my implementation.

          I made this for myself, both to learn and for a separate project
          (which ended up needed a Golang version anyway!) but if you find it
          valueable you can monetarily contribute to its ongoing development
          here: <a className="underline underline-offset-5 bg-hover" href="https://buymeacoffee.com/mharkness">Buy me a coffee</a>
        </p>
        <em>it's just me, i'm new to this, give me ideas and advice â€” please!</em>

          Thanks, Michael x
